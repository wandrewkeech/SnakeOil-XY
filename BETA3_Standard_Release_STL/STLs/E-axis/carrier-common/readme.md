# ABOUT the new lighter variant of toolhead front plate

Because of the way the belt installed, if we install other end of the belt to the back tensioner first then install the belt on the front slot, the belt will be too long and we don't have much range left for the tensioner. This is how I think the install process should be :

- 1 Install the belt on the back tensioner and set the tension to lowest possible
- 2 Thru the belt into the front slot and mark the position where the belt should bend
- 3 remove the back tesioner from toolhead-back-plate
- 4 Install the belt on the front slot using the marked position in step 2
- 5 Install the tesioner back into toolhead-back-plate
- 6 Double check and cut the belt if everything work
