# Nevermore mount for SnakeOil-XY 250 **(UNTESTED)**

There are two options for the 250 version
- Forward-facing 
- Sideways-facing, which potentially allows for installing two filters

The STEP file includes both versions (one of them mirrored)

## Forward-facing **(UNTESTED)**

I've also included and optional 1515 plenum support adapter (forward-facing only), but it may not be necessary.

## Sideways-facing (optional 2x filters) **(UNTESTED)**
- Note that Plenum's rear support is cut off in this version to provide clearance for the back-to-back-filters.
