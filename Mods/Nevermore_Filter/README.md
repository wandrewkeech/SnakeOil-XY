# Nevermore Micro Mount for SnakeOil-XY

## Overview

This mod uses a custom plenum that mounts from the bottom (in stead of the side). I've been using it for roughly 100+ hours and have had zero issues so far. It's made a huge difference in the ABS fumes, and I also saw an increase in chamber temps by about ~5-7C.

Currently supports:
  - 180 size
    - 2020 bed - tested ✅
    - 1515 bed - untested ❓
  - 250 size 1515 bed - untested ❓
    - Can mount forward-facing, or sideways (potentially fitting 2x filters!)
  - IDEX 1515 bed - untested ❓
    - Easily fits 2x filters

## Printed parts

You will need to print the following parts:
  - **Custom Nevermore plenum**
    - Same for all sizes, except the 250 sideways mount for fitting 2x filters back-to-back
  - **Left and right mounts** inside their respective directories
  - **Center brace** (IDEX only)
  - **Nevermore cartridge**
    - You can use any Nevermore cartridge that you like, but I've supplied a custom cartridge that faces downward **and** uses the slide-in magnets. This worked the best for my use-case.
  - **[Optional] cartridge supports** to prevent cartridge from falling during printing (180 size 2020 bed only)
  - **[Optional] 1515 adapter** to support plenum against the back 1515 extrusion (originally designed to fit 2020 slot)
