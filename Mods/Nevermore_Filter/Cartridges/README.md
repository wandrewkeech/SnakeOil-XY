# Preferred Nevermore Cartridges for SnakeOil-XY

The [V18_cartridge_RC2.stl](
https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro/blob/4df5884a6275a27d29d09b3c8c44b67c10dba5ab/V5_Duo/1.8/V18_cartridge_RC2.stl) from the official Nevermore repository is a great option, as it blows the air at a slightly downward angle.

However, my magnets kept falling out so I combined the above file with ChainsDD's [slide-in magnets mod](https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro/tree/4df5884a6275a27d29d09b3c8c44b67c10dba5ab/V5_Duo/Mods/Slide-in-Magnets_by-ChainsDD).

The magnets are slightly weaker when behind the plastic, so you will most likely need some kind of support for the cartridge if you use this version.
