#### Depending on the type of brackets that you have, for SnakeOil frame you may need to use up to three different types

##### By default, SnakeOil uses:
- 29pcs HBLFSN6 type brackets

##### But if you don't have access to misumi brackets then you can use some others with these dimensions:
- 21pcs "normal" meaning rather no limitation on width and length. You can use the ones like in the picture. (dimensions 35x35x28)<br>

- 3pcs "30mm long", meaning rather no limitation on width but the length can be max 30mm.<br>
You can use the same brackets as above, you just need to cut or sand off a 5mm (dimensions 30x35x28)<br>

- 5pcs "20mm wide", meaning rather no limitation on length but the width can be max 20mm.<br>
You can use the same type of brackets as above but this time the version for 2020 profiles instead of 3030. (dimensions 28x28x20)<br>
