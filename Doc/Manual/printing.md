# Print setting

## Slicer config

This is the setting I'm using but any other settings will work as long as the parts are strong enough.

<pre>Layer height : 0.2mm
Wall count : 5
Top/bottom layer : 5
Infill : 30% Gyroid 
Outer wall line width : 0.4mm
Inner wall line width : 0.45mm
Infill line width : 0.5mm
</pre>

## Filament

- In theory, PETG and higher temp-resistant filaments will work.
- Motor mount and tool head parts might require higher themp-resistant filament.
- If possible use strong filament for Z axis parts.
- Gillter or CF filled filaments might make the parts more brittle.
